The structure of Storm is currently:

Code	      Code generation.
Compiler      The Storm compiler itself.
Core	      Core types in Storm. Included in DLL:s as well as the main compiler.
Core/Gen      Template files for the CppTypes preprocessor.
CppTyes	      Preprocessor for C++ code. Extracts the neccessary type information.
doc	      Documentation.
Experiments   C++ sources which are compiled into asm to examine C++ behaviour.
External      External Storm code, not to be committed in the main repository.
Main	      Entry-point for the standalone compiler. Produces Storm.exe.
mps	      The MPS garbage collector. This is a Git submodule.
Old	      Old sources. See below.
Plugin	      Plugins for various editors (currently only Emacs).
OS	      OS-specific interface, provides threading, generic function calls and more.
Test	      Test cases for all parts of Storm. Alter its behaviour in 'stdafx.h'
Test/Code     Tests for code generation.
Test/Core     Tests for the core Storm classes required for proper operation of the compiler.
Test/Gc	      Tests for the Gc-integration.
Test/Lib      Test library.
Test/OS	      Tests of the OS library.
Test/Storm    Tests for the compiler itself.
TestData      Data required for some tests.
Utils	      Generic C++ utilities. Majority of things here should be moved elsewhere.
root	      Root for Storm code.

The folder Old contains sources for an older version of the compiler where refcouting
was used to keep track of memory. These sources are only kept around for easy reference
when debugging at the moment and will be removed eventually. The tag 'old-refcount' points
to the last commit before the rewrite started. Old contains this structure:

Code	      Code generation.
CodeTest      Tests for code generation.
Graphics      Graphics library (eg. loading images)
LibOgg	      Sources for libogg
Shared	      Shared code.
Sound	      Sound playback.
Storm	      Old core. Being migrated into Compiler
StormBuiltin  Preprocessor for the C++ code.
StormGui      UI library.
StormMain     Entry-point for the standalone compiler. Rename into Storm later?
StormTest     Tests for the Storm compiler.
migrate.el    Script that uses regexes for migrating code from Old/ to the current release.

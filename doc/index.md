----------

Storm is currently a work in progress, and it is not ready for any official releases yet. Therefore,
there is no version numbering for binaries and documentation at the moment. This will be introduced
when the language is closer to completion.

Currently, Storm only works on Windows, 32-bit. It will be ported to other platforms in the future,
but nothing is planned yet, the main focus is to complete the language. The download contains an
executable along with demo and test code and a sample implementation of Brainfuck. Source code of
the compiler itself is not availiable at the moment, but it will probably be released in the future.

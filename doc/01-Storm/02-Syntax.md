Syntax
=======

Syntax is a central part of Storm. The Storm compiler provides a parser that reads syntax from the
type system. This system is then used to implement other languages, like Basic Storm. The syntax
definitions in the compiled are designed so that it is easy to choose a set of packages and combine
their syntax, and in that way extend the language you are using.

This section will not discuss how syntax rules are written, please refer to [BNF
Syntax][md://03-BNF_Syntax] to learn how to use the built in syntax definition language.

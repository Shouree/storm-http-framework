Markdown Library
================

The package [stormname:markdown] contains a library for parsing Markdown into a DOM-like
representation. It is then possible to manipulate the representation and export it to HTML for use
in other locations.

The sub-package [stormname:markdown.doc] offers a library that compiles documentation from Markdown
files into a set of HTML-files, to make an easily accessible web version of documentation. This
library provides various extensions to the base Markdown language, such as syntax highlighting, and
checked hyperlinks between pages. This library is used to generate the Storm webpage that you are
probably using to read this text.

The documentation library is split into three parts:

1. [*Supported parts of the Markdown language*](md:Markdown)

2. [*Using the Markdown Library*](md:Usage)

3. [*The Markdown Documentation Library*](md:Documentation)

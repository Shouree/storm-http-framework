Standard Library
================

This section of the manual describes Storm's standard library. The standard library is located in
the package `core` and a few sub-packages, and contains central data structures and utilities for
languages to use. The types in the standard library also serve as a common language for exchanging
data between languages, since most languages are likely to implment the corresponding concepts in
the language in terms of the Storm standard library.

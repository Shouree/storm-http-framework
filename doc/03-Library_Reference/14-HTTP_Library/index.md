HTTP Library
===========

The package [stormname:http] contains a HTTP library. The library consists of two main parts:

- A parser interface to parse http messages

- A server interface to setup a http server with callback functions for requests

As such, documentation of the SQL library is divided into two sections. The first describes the
generic database interface, and the second describes the language extension.


The HTTP library was originally developed by: Christoffer Lundell, Erik Bäck Lindström, Filip Wojtulewicz, Fabian Pranke, Joel Gustafsson, Martin Weman

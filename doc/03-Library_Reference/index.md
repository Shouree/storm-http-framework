Library Reference
=================

This section of the documentation covers the libraries in Storm. Perhaps the most important of these
libraries is the [standard library](md:Standard_Library), which contains the building blocks for the
remainder of the libraries, such as the `Int` type, and `Array`s.

The goal of this section of the manual is to provide an overview of the libraries, not to provide
all details. For the full details, the reader is referred to the [built in documentation in
Storm](md:/Introduction/Help), which contains complete listings of members, and a description of the
functionality. As such, the goal of this section is to provide an overview to make it possible to
navigate and understand the built-in documentation.

This section of the manual generally uses [Basic Storm](md:/Language_Reference/Basic_Storm) to
illustrate how the libraries are used. As such, it might be necessary to look at the language manual
for Basic Storm at times. However, Basic Storm is fairly similar to Java and C++, so it should be
possible to understand the idea of the libraries regardless.

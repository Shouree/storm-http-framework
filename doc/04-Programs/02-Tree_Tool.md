Tree Tool
=========

The package `trees` contains a simple tree visualization tool. It was created to visualize AVL trees
during lessons conducted remotely. It is thus not aimed at performing many operations automatically,
but rather to provide a visual aid for trees that is simple to manipulate.

The program can be started by writing `trees:main` at the Storm interactive prompt, or by specifying
the following command line: `./Storm -f trees.main`.

```stormdoc
!trees
```

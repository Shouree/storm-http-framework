Tutorials
=========

Idea for outline:

- Simple example in Basic Storm, basic IO, file access.
- Small example with different threads, to illustrate the threading model
- Using the UI library
- Using the syntax language, write a small grammar, use it. Perhaps also with the parser library.
- Syntax extension to Basic Storm (+ usage example)
  - Extending the grammar
  - Case for generating new top-level constructs
  - Case for generating new AST nodes
    - Both generate IR directly, and using nodes in the AST
- Creating a simple language (just functions that evaluate simple expressions)

New Entities in the Name Tree
=============================

- We also want some top-level thing. Maybe adding a note to the name tree (e.g. a note or
  something)?

- First add an entity. Then create a simple extension to Basic Storm to create it easily. Then show
  that we can not really use it easily, so make it into a function that returns the entity instead.

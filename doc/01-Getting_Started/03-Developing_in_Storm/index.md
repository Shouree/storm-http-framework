Developing in Storm
===================

This section of the manual covers topics related to program development in Storm. It starts simple
with a few tips on how to interpret error messages and the like, and then goes on to describe how to
successively integrate different parts of Storm into an editor (currently, Emacs) to make program
development easier. Finally, it covers how to compile Storm from source code, which allows making
changes to Storm itself, and to develop libraries that interact with native system libraries.

Running Bundled Programs
========================

Programs distributed alongside Storm are started in roughly the same way across the supported
operating systems. However, this subsection is divided by operating system for clarity. This section
assumes that you have already [installed](md:/Getting_Started/Installing_Storm) storm.

Windows
-------

The easiest way to start one of the bundled programs is to locate the directory where you unpacked
Storm, and then double click the `.bat` file that corresponds to the program you wish to start. For
example, `Progvis.bat` to launch Progvis.

It is also possible to create shortcuts on the desktop by dragging the corresponding file to the
desktop using the *right* mouse button and then selecting "Create shortcut". It is *not* possible to
simply copy the launcher to the desktop as it requires the other files in the archive to run.


Linux
-----

If you installed Storm by downloading an archive from this webpage, the easiest way to start an
application is to navigate to the directory where you extracted the archive and double-click the
`.sh` file that corresponds to the program you wish to start. For example, `progvis.sh` to launch
Progvis.

If you installed Storm from the system repositories, you can find applications (like Progvis) in the
system menu as long as you installed the corresponding package.

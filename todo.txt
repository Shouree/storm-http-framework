Also: return types for rules may be specified.

In basic storm: Allow the dot operator to be used as scope resolution as well (maybe another in BS? like in cpp?)

Extract the inheritance logic from the Type class into a separate class, making the Type class smaller.

The size of built-in types is not entirely correct at the moment. The current architecture's size is
used for both values in Size at the moment, which will not work when running saved code from x86 on x86-64.

Consider adding the -> syntax for captures in BNF rules, to be symmetric with other variables.

Re-think the equals() in object! Idea: use a global equals with cached specific implementations in Type. This
can also be used to implement > < and others!

Check exceptions in UThreads!

Remove Printable::toS(), use the global toS() instead?

When functions called by the syntax transform returns objects, we leak memory. Fix!

Check for circular dependencies while loading packages. Eg. .sto language requires core.lang, which contains a .sto file.

In the reference system, Reference should instead of containing a human-readable string contain some kind
of reference to what it provides (at least in most cases), so that the reference system can do a graph
search to find islands of code that are separated from the rest of the references.

Note to self:
Parsing works _bad_ on rules like this: ( DELIMITER )*.

In bs: check the lifetime of temporary objects! It is currently too long (same as the enclosing block, should
be something like the same statement instead).

Idea for a better solution in the parser: Detect potentially empty rules, and complete them directly.

Future test cases:
Extend a class with an inlined function, and override that function.
Compilation error in a function => ensure so that the next invocation returns the same error.


Replace TypeError(x, L".....") with TypeError(x, from, to);

Protocol:

All messages start with a null byte. Everything else is interpreted as text and outputted verbatim to the output.

Entries are encoded as follows:
First byte  	    Meaning
0x00  		    nil.
0x01  		    cons. read two entries.
0x02		    number. read 4 bytes in network order
0x03		    string. read 4 bytes size and then n bytes in utf-8
0x04		    symbol. new symbol, read 4 bytes for its id, then a string.
0x05		    symbol. read 4 bytes, look up in the hash table.

Note: symbols are stored in a hash table for the server and the client. The server starts at high
id:s while the client starts allocating symbols at low id:s. Note that the server and the client
might accidentally allocate different id:s for the same symbol. This is not a problem.

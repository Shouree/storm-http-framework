* General [2/7]
  - [ ] Window should probably update 'myPos' whenever a window is resized.
  - [ ] Graphics::fill does not behave correctly with regards to gradient's coordinate systems.
  - [ ] Add a way to create proper modal dialogs with return codes.
  - [ ] Make the text view and the multiline text view separate, as we want
        to handle text separatly in the two cases.
  - [ ] Investigate why GTK_MT_HW_COPY experiences fairly large (around 500 ms) stutters from time to time.
        This could be due to our handling of double buffers, but also due to Gtk+ not liking that we're bypassing it.
  - [X] Investigate why OpenGL rendering fails when maximizing a window containing GL rendering over X forwarding to Windows.
  - [X] Figure out a way to unify the onKey and onChar messages. They are different on Win32 and the same on GTK.

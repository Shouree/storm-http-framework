TODO:

- Rename things in C++: find . -name "*.h" | xargs grep -rI "operator *<<.*StrBuf"
  - Done! The remaining ones are enums and C++ internals.
- Update logic to find toS() in Type for the Handles
- Update logic in Basic Storm that uses toS.
- Update enum (and other types in lib/ to follow the new convention)
  - Enum done, but needs to be tested.
  - Default logic for adding toS to core needs to be replaced with two parts:
    - one that adds toS() that calls StrBuf (ok, but untested)
    - one that adds << operator as needed (ok, but untested)

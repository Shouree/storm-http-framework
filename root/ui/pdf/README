This package contains a class, PdfGraphics, that implements the interface of a Graphics object, but
renders to PDF files. The implementation supports the entire graphics API, however, not all PDF
readers seem to support pattern brushes, which are used if a BitmapBrush is used in a drawing.

The output is not compressed in any way, meaning that the resulting PDF file becomes fairly large
when using images. This can be solved by re-encoding the file with Ghostscript for
example. Furthermore, any fonts used in the file are not embedded in the file, which may result in
fonts looking different on different machines. This problem can also be solved by re-encoding the
file using Ghostscript.

Re-encoding can be done with the command:

gs -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE -q -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -o new.pdf old.pdf


Tests for this package can be found in test/pdf/test.bs

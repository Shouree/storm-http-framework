* Things to fix here [0/2]
  - [ ] When editing large-ish syntax files, adding a new rule or production is broken.
        It seems this is due to the file being in the sweet spot where the heuristic is
        happy enough to accept the solution where the new thing is parsed as whitespace,
        but not eager enough to parse the entire file again. This is fixed after a fairly
        large amount of edits (~3 productions) and a few seconds, so it could mean
        that the timeouts should be more aggressive.
  - [ ] The language server loses some characters when editing neare a Part boundary,
        such as after use statements in Basic Storm. This is especially visible when
        the boundaries are changed.

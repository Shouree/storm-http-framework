* Loose ends so far [9/20]
  - [ ] Destructors in maps and arrays are not working properly yet. Idea: add (yet another) member 
        to array headers, and let the user provide a custom destructor in there if neccessary.
  - [ ] Destructors do not need their own slot in the vtables anymore since we have another mechanism for that.
  - [ ] Check so that destructors are required if a value-type object within a class or actor
        contains a destructor.
  - [ ] Improve the preprocessor by automatically adding copy constructors and assignment operators
        where neccessary.
  - [ ] Improve the preprocessor by generating toS() and deepCopy() if not present.
  - [ ] Finish the clone() functionality.
  - [ ] Make sure Array<>, Map<> and Set<> clear the memory when an element is removed.
  - [ ] Make a generic toS() for Storm which uses operator << (if present) for values.
  - [ ] Verify so that integers can not be casted to integers.
  - [ ] Function pointers should maybe allow casting to less specific types of parameters.
  - [ ] if (x = foo.bar) does not produce an error if 'foo.bar' is not Maybe<T>.
  - [X] The grammar rule X : Y ("w", Y)* "w"; does not parse properly. It should either work as expected 
        or report an error!
  - [X] Thread sleep needs to be improved! We should put threads in a sleep queue so that the thread
        can be properly put to sleep even if there is another uthread active on the current thread.
  - [X] Review the semantics of Buffer::filled() wrt IStream::read. Buffer::filled could be used instead
        of the explicit 'start' parameter. This allows a Buffer to be passed to 'read' multiple times
        to fill the buffer until completion.
  - [X] Handles for values do not get a proper == operator.
  - [X] Enums should be treated like raw integers (currently they are Values).
  - [X] Destructors should be auto-generated in Basic Storm if they are needed.
  - [X] It seems we fail to handle moving objects in Set and Map in rare cases. Examine why!
  - [X] Implement shrink() for Map<> as well.
  - [X] Handles and templates does not work with built-in types (like Int).

* Improvements [4/14]
  - [ ] Use the LO pool for object formats, this should make it possible to have them garbage collected
        and readable during scanning.
  - [ ] Cache and re-use the function thunks generated by CodeGen/callThunk().
  - [ ] Properly handle failure conditions when creating Threads and UThreads (eg. out of memory).
  - [ ] Rename 'TObject' to 'Actor' to make it easier to understand.
  - [ ] Fix destructors in Storm...
  - [ ] Clone objects using a member function generated by the STORM_CLASS macro or the preprocessor.
  - [ ] Generate toS() and deepCopy() automatically using the preprocessor unless supressed.
  - [ ] We can remove a lot of copy-constructors in Code/, and use memcpy + default generated ones!
  - [ ] Remove mov eax, eax (or similar) They are occasionally generated if we're unlucky.
  - [ ] Idea: disallow cloning of values without deepCopy() so that we can safely make iterators for actors.
  - [X] The syntax SExpr (, SExpr)? is treated as a parameter list. Switch to {} for capture so that
        this does not happen. (requiring SExpr - (,SExpr) instead), stricter parsing.
  - [X] Implement attaching and detaching threads using ThreadGroups for os::Thread.
  - [X] Make it possible to mark entire rules with syntax colors. That would be equivalent to marking
        all usages of that token with the corresponding color.
  - [X] In Array.get(), do not create the exception in getRaw() since it takes up a lot of valuable space in
        the i-cache. Instead, call a separate function or reverse the logic.

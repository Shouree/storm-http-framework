* Loose ends so far [0/3]
  - [ ] Destructors in maps and arrays are not working properly yet. Idea: add (yet another) member 
        to array headers, and let the user provide a custom destructor in there if neccessary.
  - [ ] Implement shrink() for Map<> as well.
  - [ ] Handles and templates does not work with built-in types (like Int).

* Improvements [0/2]
  - [ ] Clone objects using a member function generated by the STORM_CLASS macro or the preprocessor.
  - [ ] Generate toS() and deepCopy() automatically using the preprocessor unless supressed.
